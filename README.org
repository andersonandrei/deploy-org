Use the Emacs  configuration files in this repository to  deploy Emacs, org, and
ESS in your system. Tested in different distributions using Docker.

To  install this  configuration in  your system  directly, *backup  your init.el
file*, then run:

#+begin_SRC bash :results output :session *Shell* :eval no-export :exports code
git clone https://github.com/phrb/deploy-org.git
cd deploy-org
sudo ./install/install.sh -i
./install/install.sh -e -t
#+end_SRC

You should  check the Emacs and  org versions, and  you should see a  ="PDF file
produced."=  message, indicating  that org  succesfully compiled  the test  file
=org/journal/journal.org=   to   =pdf=.    Tests    are   implemented   in   the
=install/install.sh= script.

You can  check the  status on  each supported system  using Docker.   For Ubuntu
20.04.2 LTS, for example, run:

#+begin_SRC bash :results output :session *Shell* :eval no-export :exports code
cd docker/ubuntu_20042_lts
sudo docker build .
#+end_SRC
